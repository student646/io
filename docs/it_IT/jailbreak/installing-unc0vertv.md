unc0verTV is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered jailbreak</router-link>, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

unc0verTV is capable of jailbreaking all devices on tvOS 11.0 to 13.4.5, as well as tvOS 13.4.8 beta 1.

Due to how semi-untethered jailbreaks work, the app will need to be <router-link to="/resigning-apps">re-signed</router-link> once every 7 days.

We will use Sideloadly to install the unc0verTV jailbreak application to your Apple TV for use in the next step.

## Installare l'applicazione

::: warning

As the Apple TV 4K does not have a USB-C port, you will need to instead navigate to Settings > Remote Apps & Devices > Remote Devices on your Apple TV, rather than plugging it in.

:::

1. Apri Sideloadly
2. Plug your Apple TV into your computer
   - Assicurati che il tuo computer sia autorizzato a vedere i contenuti del dispositivo
3. Drag and drop the unc0verTV `.ipa` file into Sideloadly
4. Inserisci il tuo ID Apple
5. Inserisci la tua password
   - Sideloadly must make a request to its servers in order to work with free developer accounts. Se non sei d’accordo, puoi sempre usare un Apple ID alternativo.

The app will now install to your Apple TV. Once that's done, the unc0verTV application can now be opened from home screen.

## Running unc0verTV

5. Click "Jailbreak" again
   - If it automatically reboots or crashes and the jailbreak is not installed, wait 1-2 minutes, then try again.
