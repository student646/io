## Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 4.3 to 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 to 4.3.5 on iPad 2 devices. However, this device can update to 9.3.5 and use the kok3shi jailbreak instead.

Due to the age of this iOS version, you will need to use iTunes or similar to manually update the device to iOS 9.3.5, as updating on the device was not a thing at the time of iOS 4.3.

## Updating to 9.3.5

1. Plug your device into your computer.
1. On iTunes or Finder, locate your device.
1. Select `Check for Update`.
1. Select `Download and Update`
    - Ensure that the version you are updating to is iOS 9.3.5
