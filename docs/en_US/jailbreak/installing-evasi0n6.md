Evasi0n is capable of jailbreaking all devices on iOS 6.0 to 6.1.2

Evasi0n is an untethered jailbreak, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device.

In order to use Evasi0n, you will need a Windows computer running Windows XP or newer, macOS 10.5 to 10.14, or a Linux distro with kernel version 2.6.24+ and libgtk+-2.0 version 2.24.13+ and the appropriate version of evasi0n from the Legacy JB Archive.
<!-- works for sure on win11, and i think it's a 32bit app so mojave and older (well it launched on my mojave install so...). i couldn't be bothered launching on linux but if someone actually uses the guide and they use linux they're a legend and honestly they can just come ask me on legacyjb if they have issues like holy shit lol -->
