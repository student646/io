greenpois0n is capable of jailbreaking every iOS device except the iPhone 3G on firmware versions 4.1, 4.2.1, and 4.2.6, as well as the iPad 1st Generation on version 3.2.2

greenpois0n is an <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#untethered-jailbreaks">untethered</router-link> jailbreak meaning that it survives a reboot and can cause a permanent bootloop if something goes wrong. If you encounter a bootloop, restore your device via iTunes, Finder (macOS Catalina and newer) or FutureRestore  
You will need a computer running macOS 10.11 or older or Windows XP - 8.1. Wine will not work.
