::: warning

Cydia is incredibly unmaintained and does not support several modern functions, as a result, we generally recommend using a more modern package manager if your device supports it. 

If you are on iOS 12 or newer, consider using <router-link to="/installing-sileo">Sileo</router-link> instead.

If you are on iOS 9 or newer, consider using <router-link to="/installing-zebra">Zebra</router-link> instead.
