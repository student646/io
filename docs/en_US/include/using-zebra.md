Zebra is a newer package manager. It can be used to install tweaks and themes.

<p><router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">Tweaks</router-link> are small modifications to change the look and/or feel of your device. You can find tweaks on repositories, colloquially referred to as "repos".</p>

<p><router-link to="/faq/#what-s-a-repo">Repositories</router-link> are essentially databases that contain lots of tweaks for you to install. When you add repos to Zebra, you will be able to install the tweaks on it, and look for them using the search function.</p>

This guide will show you how you can install and uninstall tweaks, and add different repos.

## Adding Repos

1. Open the Zebra application
1. Tap `Sources` on the bar at the bottom
1. Tap the `+` icon in the top left-hand corner
1. Enter in a repo URL (e.g. [`https://sparkdev.me/`](https://sparkdev.me/))
1. Tap `Add Source`

You can now enter the repo from this page to see all the tweaks available on it.

## Removing Repos

1. Open the Zebra application
1. Tap `Sources` on the bar at the bottom
1. Slide the repo you want to remove all the way to the left.

The repo should now be removed from Zebra.

## Installing Tweaks

1. Open the Zebra application
1. Search for a tweak you'd like to install
1. Tap the `Install` button at the top right-hand corner of your screen
    - If a prompt asking you what version to install appears, you generally want to install the latest version
1. Tap on the bottom of the screen where it says "Tap to Manage"
1. Tap the `Confirm` button at the top right-hand corner of your screen
    - It may take some time for the tweak to install
1. After it's finished, tap "<router-link to="/faq/#what-is-respringing">Restart SpringBoard</router-link>"
    - The device should appear to reboot after this
    - Sometimes, the button might not say to Restart SpringBoard, but you can tap the button anyway

The tweak should now be installed to your device and will be active whenever your device is jailbroken.
